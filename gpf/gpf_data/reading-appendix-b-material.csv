2,1,Information (Description),Van,G2-E1.md,NA,NA,"This extremely short text (22 words) describes a familiar activity of a child drawing a picture using very common words. There is one longer sentence, which is a list of the things Van draws. There is minimal competing information; the colors of the leaves are predictably green and the flowers are red. There is a very simple implied connection that Van is using the new pencils to draw.",NA
2,2,Information (Description),Maya,G2-E2.md,NA,NA,"This extremely short text (23 words) describes a familiar short sequence of three events, using very common words: coming home from school, sweeping the yard, and having a snack. There is minimal competing information, as a second person, Mum, is mentioned once. There is a simple, predictable implication that Mum will be pleased with Maya’s work.",NA
2,3,Information,The Pippi,G2-E3.md,"[""G2-E3.png""]",NA,"This very short text (30 words) presents a simple idea about a familiar concept of a sea shell (the text is not suitable for students with no concept of a sea shell). All of the words are very common except for “pippi.” However, this is the name of the animal and is strongly supported by the illustrations.",NA
3,1,Story,The Mango,G3-E1.md,NA,NA,"This is a short text (55 words) of 8 sentences that uses common words. The setting of walking along on a hot day should be familiar to most students, even those from cool climates. In this story, Abdul’s problem is that he is hot, tired, hungry, and cross. The consequence is that he lies under a cool tree to sleep. His problem is resolved
when a mango drops on his head. This is a simple, straightforward story with a single character. While the outcome, Abdul’s happiness, might be
predictable, the way the outcome happens is not.
The character’s name, gender, and the kind of fruit tree can be changed to make them familiar to students.",NA
3,2,Story,Tadala’s deed,G3-E2.md,NA,NA,"This is a short text (76 words) and 7 sentences that uses common words. The context of finding and handing in a lost article should be familiar to students, as should the idea of being rewarded for providing assistance. In this story, the problem is that Tadala finds a bag, which he gives to the chief. As a consequence, he receives an unexpected reward. This is a simple, straightforward story. While the outcome of Tadala being rewarded in some way for doing the right thing might be predictable, the nature of the reward is not. The character’s name and the gifts given as a reward can be changed so that they are familiar. The village chief can be changed to an appropriate person to manage lost property. The gender of the characters can also be changed.",NA
3,3,Story,The fox and the grapes,G3-E3.md,NA,NA,"This is a short text (57 words) with 8 sentences, including some very short sentences. There are two less common words, “laughing” and “boasting,” that are supported in context and are also fairly predictable. The context should be familiar to students. In this story, the problem is that the fox wants some grapes and boasts that he is strong enough to jump up and get them. The fox fails and a donkey laughs at him. The reason for the donkey’s amusement and the fox’s consequent change in attitude is explicitly stated. There is a clear implication that the fox is humiliated or embarrassed. This is a straightforward, familiar interaction between two characters, with details that are specific to this story. The kinds of animals and the kind of overhanging fruit can be changed so that they are familiar to students.",NA
3,4,Information (Description),Grass,G3-E4.md,NA,NA,"This is a short text (72 words) with 6 mainly longer sentences. Most of the vocabulary is common. Students should be familiar with the idea of soil, even if they are not used to reading this word. This is a simple description of how grass can grow in the cracks of rocks. Grass is likely to be a familiar plant for all students, but the detail about how the soil and seeds get into the cracks of rocks is unlikely to be prior knowledge. Students may not realize that water and warmth are also essential for the grass to grow. It should not be necessary to modify this text for different contexts",NA
3,5,Information (Description),Aliyah,G3-E5.md,NA,NA,"This is a short text (83 words) with 8 sentences. Most of the vocabulary is common. “Meadows” is supported by the context, and students should be familiar with the base words “slip” and “slide” even if they have not read “slippery” and “sliding” before. This is a simple description of Aliyah’s life in the mountains. There is a simple contrast between life with the sheep in the summer and the winter, and a brief description of how the mountain tracks make legs strong and are used for playing a game. The text is appropriate for students with some understanding of cold weather and ice, even if they have not experienced this kind of weather themselves. The name and gender of the person providing the description can be changed.",NA
4,1,Story,The Accident,G4-E1.md,NA,NA,"This text is only slightly longer (97 words) than the grade three texts, but it has more complexity. It includes less common vocabulary: “position,” ankle,” “swelling,” “ambulance,” and “worse.” Students need to know the meaning of most of these words, as there is only limited contextual support. In this story, Than has badly hurt his leg. His parents respond by providing comfort and calling the ambulance. There are three characters who all interact with each other, and a sequence of four events: Than falling, Mum coming, Dad ringing the ambulance, and then the three characters waiting on the stairs. Most of the ideas are explicit, but some simple ideas are implied, such as that Than has broken his leg, or damaged his ankle. The names and genders can be adjusted for context and the ambulance can also be changed to a contextually appropriate health care vehicle or person.",NA
4,2,Story,Noga the Small Girl,G4-E2.md,NA,NA,"This text is considerably longer (122 words) than the grade three texts, but it is fairly straightforward. It includes some direct speech. Most of the vocabulary is common, with “worry” and “chirps” both supported by the context and predictable. Noga’s problem is her small size, but she discovers there are benefits. Noga is the main character and only has one interaction with Mum. There is some detail in a simple sequence of three events: Noga hears the bird, crawls into the hole to get the bird, and puts the bird on a branch. There is one clearly implied idea about why Noga is happy at the end.",NA
4,3,Information,The Dwarf Lantern Shark,G4-E3.md,NA,NA,"At 73 words, this text is no longer than a typical grade three text, but it contains less familiar information, and the information is contrary to expectations (and therefore surprising), so is likely to present more of a challenge to the reader. There is some less familiar vocabulary, with the meaning of “harmless” and “glow” being strongly supported in context. This text should not require adjusting for context. Students should be familiar with the idea of a shark, but students are not expected to be familiar with the details about the dwarf lantern shark. The concept of light and darkness should also be familiar to all.",NA
4,4,Information,Animals in Nature,G4-E4.md,NA,NA,"This text is longer than grade three texts (110 words) and contains a significant amount of information. The concepts of “prey” and “predator” may be unfamiliar but they are explained at the beginning of the text. There is a large amount of detail in comparison with a grade three-level text. This text refers to several kinds of animals, some of which are likely to be familiar, and some less familiar to students. It is important that some animals and their behavior are unfamiliar, as students should not be able to answer the questions based on prior knowledge. If necessary, some less familiar animal examples may need to be used.",also used for G3 aural comprehension.
5,1,Information,The Giant Coconut Crab,G5-E1.md,NA,NA,"This is a longer text, at 177 words, with a significant amount of information and detailed description. There is some variation from the conventional objective style of an information text (in the second half of the first paragraph: “Take one really big step …”), which may introduce a challenge to the student reader. Most of the vocabulary is common with “enemy” supported in context. The structure of an information text that describes an unfamiliar animal in terms of location, size, food, and other features should be familiar to students. There is one implied idea about the reason for the alternative names of “robber crab” or “palm thief.” This text is suitable for students who are familiar with the crab as an animal, but do not know the details about this particular crab. Students do need to be familiar with a coconut and a coconut palm tree. A simple, labeled illustration of a coconut palm with coconuts would be appropriate if students are likely to require support.",NA
5,2,Information,Salt,G5-E2.md,NA,NA,"This is also a longer text (157 words) with a significant amount of information about the different uses for salt. The structure of the text as a list of different uses should be familiar. Most of the vocabulary is common, but students need to know words like “muscles,” “flow,” and “dizzy,” as there is minimal support. Also, students who do not know the word “chimneys” are unlikely to know, or be able to work out, the meaning of “soot.” The meaning of “survive” is supported by the context. There are no implied ideas. Students should be familiar with salt and most of the contexts in which salt is used. It may be appropriate to change the example of cleaning soot from chimneys to a more familiar context for some students.",Also used in G4 aural comprehension.
5,3,Story,Chiumbo and the goats,G5-E3.md,NA,NA,"This is a considerably longer text (229 words), but it has a simple, repetitive structure and most of the ideas are explicitly stated. The vocabulary is mainly common, with “frighten,” “crept,” and “truth” supported by the context. There is one main character and multiple minor characters, but the story itself is simple. Chiumbo sleeps and his goats are saved first by the old man and then by birds, but the third time, the goats are stolen. Chiumbo confesses his crime of sleeping on the job, the policeman rescues the goats and Chiumbo learns his lesson. The name and gender of the main character and the kind of animals being herded can be changed and the policeman can also be changed to a contextually appropriate law and order enforcement person.",Also used in G4 aural comprehension.
5,4,Procedural,Orange and Cardamom Fruit Salad,G5-E4.md,NA,NA,"This non-continuous text is in the form of a recipe. It has two parts: a simple list (the ingredients) and a numbered list of steps in the procedure (the instructions). The subheadings, “Ingredients” and “Instructions,” are paratextual features with a different print format. Students may not be familiar with cardamom, but it is sufficient that that are told it is a spice. The main challenge is for students to realize that only one of the oranges is juiced and the other three oranges are mixed with the raisins in the bowl. This aspect is implied. The ingredients could be changed according to local context, but the challenges in the process should remain the same and have some novelty for students. The recipe is not suitable to use in contexts where it is so familiar that many students can answer the questions based on prior knowledge.",NA
6,1,Information,Sevan Trout,G6-E1.md,NA,NA,"This text is a similar length (161 words) to “Salt,” the information text in grade five. The additional complexity here is the causal relationship between the main ideas. An initially good idea of putting more fish into the lake goes wrong for two different reasons. An attempt to rectify the problem is not successful for different reasons again. The text includes place names and nouns that are likely to be unfamiliar, but only need to be recognized as place names or the names of fish. “Endangered” and “extinct” are explained in context. The structure of an information text as an outline of issues and problematic solutions may also be less familiar to students. The idea of fishing and using water from a lake should be familiar to all, even if the location is not.",NA
6,2,Story,The Old House,G6-E2.md,NA,NA,"This is a longer text (221 words). Atmosphere and suspense are created through descriptive language and the dialogue between the characters. Some literary devices are also used to create mood: Chang’s unfinished sentence (“ … ”) and repetition (the “drip, drip” of the tap). The emotions of and relationship between the characters is enacted through direct speech and nuances of language (“hissed,” “whispered”).",NA
6,3,Information (Non-continuous),Seb’s Delivery Schedule,G6-E3-table.md,NA,G6-E3.csv,"Schedules and timetables are likely to be familiar types of non-continuous texts to students at this grade level. This table is slightly more complex than a straightforward row x column structure, as there are two main “row” categories (Morning and Afternoon) as well as the cells containing individual items brought by the boat each day. Some features of the organization are only implied: non-food goods are only delivered once a week; perishable goods are only delivered in the morning; some goods are brought several times and others only once each week. The content of the table can be adapted for local/cultural contexts, but the features described above should be retained to support inferential questions and questions about features of the content and structure of the table.",NA
7,1,Story,The Hole,G7-E1.md,NA,NA,"This is a moderately lengthy story (218 words). The contrasting characters of the brother and sister and their relationship are strong elements, alongside the narrative development. The problem of the story—the mystery of what is in the hole—is the context for Nazneen and Samsur’s character portrayal. The solution to the mystery is implied, not stated.",NA
7,2,Information,How Shells Climb Mountains,G7-E2.md,"[""G7-E2-0.png"", ""G7-E2-1.png""]",NA,"This mixed text, combining elements that are continuous (paragraphs) and non- continuous (labeled diagrams) is typical of textbook formats in subjects such as science and geography. The concepts of changes over long periods of time, and geological movements, are beyond everyday experience, as is appropriate for students in lower secondary school. On the other hand, the language use is everyday rather than technical (“squashed,” “wrinkled, like bed sheets”), which should make the content relatively approachable.",NA
7,3,Persuasive,Dear Uncle and Aunty,G7-E3.md,NA,NA,"This is a persuasive text, with the writer building a case to convince her uncle and aunt about a decision. She gives reasons that are both personal (“It makes me very happy”) and outward looking (“they will all grow up to lead good lives”) for wanting to change her career path. The reason that she needs to convince her uncle and aunt about the value of her decision is implied, rather than stated. (They gave her the opportunity to go to the city for training at a bank.) The degree of complexity of the text is created through its multiple implications and causal relationships among different elements.",NA
8,1,Information,Brushing Your Teeth,G8-E1.md,"[""G8-E1.png""]",NA,"Although this is a relatively short text (122 words), it has some implicit challenges. It presents several pieces of advice from various sources, and contains contradictory points of view and elements that are contrary to expectations. The topic is everyday but the information is surprising, and, therefore, will present some challenges to readers.",NA
8,2,Information (non-continuous text),Country Fact File,G8-E2-table.md,NA,G8-E2.csv,"This table has a straightforward row x column format, but the information content is more complex than that shown in the example of a table presented for grade six. Students are only likely to have encountered this kind of information and several of the concepts at school or through wide general knowledge: a range of climatic and geographical conditions, for example. The term “export” is explained, but may be a novel concept for students at this stage of schooling. Comparisons and contrasts between the features of the four countries may be used as the subject of questions, as well as the individual content of each cell.",NA
8,3,Story,Lazy Rabbit,G8-E3.md,NA,NA,"This is an example of a longer text, (482 words), but the narrative is quite straightforward: every action and feeling is explicit. In this case, the relatively challenging length is balanced by content in a conventional narrative mode.",NA
9,1,Information (Non-continuous Text—Labeled Diagrams),Balloon,G9-E1.md,"[""G9-E1.png""]",NA,"This text is in a largely non-continuous format of labeled diagram. In fact, it comprises a network of diagrams including sketches, a vertical scale, and a map, as well as several short pieces of prose. Its complex format is likely to create some challenge for the reader. There is only a small number of words included in the text but the text offers opportunities for thinking about the purpose for including elements of the text as well as plenty of material for straightforward locating of information.",NA
9,2,Story,Miser,G9-E2.md,NA,NA,"This is another short text in a conventional style (a fable). The rather archaic language (‘Pray do not grieve so …’), which adds a layer of challenge, would need to be preserved in translation. The story is condensed and understanding its gist requires a degree of inference.",NA
9,3,Information (Mixed Continuous and Non-continuous),First Car,G9-E3-table.md,"[""G9-E3.png""]",G9-E3.csv,"This is a mixed text, combining continuous and non-continuous elements (prose and a table). The units of measurement in the prose passage and the table, and the currency in the table, should be adapted to local metrics. Apart from those features, the text should be usable as it stands. The phenomenon of cars is widely familiar, but the information about the way cars have evolved is likely to be new to most students. Some understanding of the wider world (the notion of power, the development of mass industry, the concepts of cost and monetary inflation) will support understanding of the text, especially the table. Some elements of word choice may be moderately challenging.",NA
9,4,Persuasive,Clever or Hardworking?,G9-E4.md,NA,NA,"The attitudes of students to studying or to life ambition in general is a topic that is likely to have personal meaning for students at this stage of their education. The two texts put opposing opinions on the topic, which is explicitly labeled in the title of the unit. Both arguments are laced with opinions, so discriminating between fact and opinion is an important part of making sense of these texts.",NA
