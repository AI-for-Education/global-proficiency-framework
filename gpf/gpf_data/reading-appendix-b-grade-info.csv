2,"At grade two, texts are so short that they are mainly simple descriptions. Texts typically have a single character engaged in a simple action, or a very brief description of a single object or event. A few sentences: approximately 20-30 words in English. Everyday experiences, events, and objects that are likely to be familiar to the students.  Context or setting is familiar and somewhat predictable, but includes details that cannot be predicted to ensure that students are required to make meaning from the text. Little or no implied information, minimal competing information, and possibly also supportive illustrations. Familiar structure with a clear main idea, only one or two characters, few details. Simple words that are likely to have been encountered often and typically describe concrete concepts; may include a highly-supported uncommon word. Simple sentences or a simple compound sentence that is commonly encountered.",,,,"A reading assessment is intended to measure reading comprehension, which means a set of questions about a text must require students to read the whole text. It should not be possible for students to use general or prior knowledge to answer any questions without reading the text, or to accurately predict the answers to most questions after reading the title, or the first line. Each question may be based on a small part of the text, but as a set, the questions should require students to read all of the text.",
3,"Six or more sentences: approximately 60-80 words in English.  Common everyday experiences, events, and objects. Context or setting is familiar and somewhat predictable, but includes details that cannot be predicted to ensure that students are required to make meaning from the text. Limited competing information; simple implied information. Familiar, straightforward structure; a clear main idea with some supporting details; logical progression. A range of words with familiar meanings that typically describe concrete concepts and some common abstract concepts; may include a highly
supported uncommon word. A variety of simple sentence structures that are commonly encountered.",Table 18: Text Types at Grade 3,,"Stories, Information (descriptions)","A reading assessment is intended to measure reading comprehension, which means a set of questions about a text must require students to read the whole text.

4,"Grade four texts are typically slightly longer than grade three texts and contain more detail. However, greater complexity in one factor may be balanced by less complexity in another. For example, a shorter text may contain some less familiar content, or some less common vocabulary.",,,,,
5,"Texts may be of varying lengths and are mainly narrative (stories) and informational. Some instructional texts may also be used. Simple non-continuous texts such as lists and tables are introduced at this level. There may be some non-conventional genre elements in the texts. Narrative texts include details such as some limited character development, or a simple description of the setting. Information texts may include basic paratextual features: for example, subheadings or captions. Vocabulary includes a wide range of familiar words describing concrete and abstract concepts as well as less familiar words where the context strongly supports the meaning. For example, a common technical or discipline-specific term may be used where the meaning can be inferred from prominent clues. ",,,,,
6,"Up to 300 words. Texts may be considerably shorter depending on the kinds of complexities that are included. Generally familiar experiences and concepts that may rely on direct personal experience or school-based learning. Context is familiar but detail of information is unfamiliar and possibly 
unpredictable (contrary to expectations). Some competing information, simple implied information. Text types include continuous and non-continuous formats. May have some 
unconventional features or may be mixed in format (for example, combined continuous and non-continuous features). Vocabulary includes a wide range of familiar words describing concrete concepts and abstract concepts as well as less familiar words where the context strongly supports the meaning. For example, the meaning of common technical or discipline-specific terms can be inferred from prominent clues. Some sentence complexity and a variety of sentence forms. Content and format complexity affect the text length. More complex content may be balanced by reduced word length. Non-continuous texts typically comprise fewer words than continuous texts conveying the same information.",Table 20: Text Types at Grade 6,,"Narrative (stories), Information

7,"Texts are of varying lengths, with longer texts typically being straightforward and shorter texts a little more complex. A range of familiar text types, including narrative (stories), informational, persuasive, and instructional texts, are used at this grade level. A range of simple, non-continuous formats includes tables, diagrams, maps, and graphs. Texts typically include several minor complexities such as unfamiliar content that is clearly explained, less common vocabulary supported in context, significant implied ideas, or a less familiar structure.",,,,,

9,"Generally continuous texts of at least 250 words. Non-continuous texts are shorter. Length is highly dependent on complexity of content. Broad context may be familiar but will introduce substantial unfamiliar elements. Draws on school-based learning and some wider world knowledge. Content is not predictable, though text format and type are broadly familiar. May include substantial competing information, figurative language, and meanings that need to be inferred by the reader. Familiar text formats and structures but may have some unconventional features. (For example, chronology of a narrative may not follow the sequence of information as presented.).  A range of words with both familiar and unfamiliar meanings. General meaning (at least) can be inferred from context. Subject-specific language may be used.  In continuous texts, a variety of sentence structures and sentence lengths.",Table 22: Text Types at Grade 9,,"Stories, Information
