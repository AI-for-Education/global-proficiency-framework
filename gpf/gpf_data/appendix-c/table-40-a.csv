"Ref..","Items","Acceptable.Key.s","Notes"
"R1.2.1_P","Who was feeling very tired?","Refers to Lee","The information is prominent because it is in the first sentence. There is a direct match to “was very tired” with Lee as the adjacent information. There is limited competing information. There are only two characters and matching “feeling” alone could lead to incorrectly selecting Chang."
"R1.2.1_M","Why does Chang think no one lives in the house?","Refers to the door being unlocked or creaking open","“No one lives” can be directly matched to the start of the second paragraph, with “here” in the text needing to be matched to “house” in the question. The relevant information is nearby but requires reading across a brief exchange of conversation to locate Chang’s directly stated reason that the door was not locked."
"R1.2.1_E","List two sounds made by doors.","Refers to two of: “creak,” “groan,” or “scraping”","There are several references to doors in the text, so the word can be directly matched, but only some references to a door have an associated sound described nearby. There is extensive competing information as several other sounds are heard, but these are not caused by a door."
"R1.3.1_P","Which statement was said very quietly? A. “How can you be sure?” B. “The door wasn’t even locked!” C. “You go first.” D. “What’s that noise?”","A. “How can you be sure?”","A simple synonymous match is required between “very quietly” in the question to “whispered” in the text to identify which of the given statements was whispered. The correct answer is the first option, which is a prominent statement at the start of the text. There is limited competing information as all the statements are from the text, but only one is clearly whispered."
"R1.3.1_M","What did the boys decide was good about the house?","Refers to one of: being warm, out of the wind, able to rest","This information is not prominent. There are multiple examples of the house being scary. It is only towards the end that Chang says it is “better than being outside,” which provides a synonymous match with “good” as a desirable feature of the house. Chang then identifies warmth and rest. Either feature is acceptable. There is competing information, as the frightening elements of the house suggest it is unsuitable for resting and the howling wind suggests that it is cold."
"R1.3.1_E","Some things in the old house are broken and need to be fixed. Choose two broken things and describe how they are broken.","Refers to two of: hinge off door, tap drips, iron roof clatters, door hangs/scrapes","Some support is provided for the meaning of “broken” in the question, as these are described as “things that need to be fixed.” Two synonymous matches to broken are required from four possibilities: a hinge falls off a door, a leaky tap drips, something is clattering on the iron roof, and a hanging door is scraping. The broken objects are scattered through the text, making it harder to find two pieces, and there is some competing information, as a bed is also mentioned, but it is not broken."
"R2.1.1_P","“... something clattering on the iron roof above.” What does “clattering” mean?","Refers to making a noise/banging","In English, “clattering” sounds like the noise that it makes, providing a prominent clue. There are also multiple other clues, as most of the text is about the noises that the boys hear that make them scared. (Note that “clattering” in English is likely to be an unknown word for grade six students. This may not apply in other languages.)"
"R2.1.1_E","“The door wasn’t even locked!” How did Chang sound when he said this? A. Afraid B. Foolish C. Unsure D. Confident","D. confident","The question must be linked to the text. There are limited clues for the meaning of Chang speaking boldly, which are provided by Chang suggesting they should go, implying confidence, and in bravely, saying they need to stay in the house towards the end. However, this is undermined by Chang also pushing Lee through the door first, suggesting Chang is not very brave. There is other strongly competing information, as there are many reasons for Chang to be afraid. (Note that “boldly” in English is likely to be an unknown word for grade 6 students. This may not apply in other languages.)"
