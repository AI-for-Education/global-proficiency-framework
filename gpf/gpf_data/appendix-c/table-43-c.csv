"R3.1.3_M","Who is this text most likely written for? A. Kindergarten children B. School students C. University students D. Government officials","B: School students","The audience is not stated, but there are prominent clues that it is intended for school students. The tone of the opening paragraph suggests an audience with limited understanding of the topic. The simple language, simple diagrams, and short text length suggest it is not intended for a serious adult audience, such as university students or government officials. On the other hand, the unfamiliar content and the diagrammatic style of the graphics make the text seem an unlikely choice for kindergarten children."
"R3.1.3b_M","Who do you think this text is most suitable for? Circle one. Primary students Secondary students Give a reason for your choice using evidence from the text","Provides a plausible reason based on features of the text, e.g., primary because the pictures are easy to understand or the text is short and simple, OR secondary because the ideas are hard or there are some hard words","The most prominent evidence in the text that supports audience is likely to be the diagrams, which could be reasonably justified as simple and clear enough for primary students, or containing difficult/unfamiliar ideas or unfamiliar words, like wrinkled, and therefore suited to secondary students. Students who have been taught to reflect on the style of texts may also select examples of style to support their opinion."
