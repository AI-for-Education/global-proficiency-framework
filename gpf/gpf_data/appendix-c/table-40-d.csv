"R3.1.3_M","Who do you think is most likely to read this text? Give a reason for your opinion.","Refers to children or another possible audience with a plausible reason, e.g., children—it is a simple story; teachers—to use in class","Narratives are a familiar text type. The text has prominent features of a simple story, as it is concerned with the feelings and interactions between two characters. There is a simple plot: the characters need to rest, have reservations because the house is scary, but eventually decide to stay. This makes for prominent clues that the audience is likely children, or people concerned with children, such as a teacher reading to the class or a parent reading to children, or someone who is learning to read themselves. A simple reason is required to allow for plausible justification of a range of possible audiences depending on context."
"R3.2.1_P","Chang seems to be quite brave in this story. What kind of a boy do you think Lee is?","Provides a plausible opinion about Lee","Chang being quite brave is provided as an example to show that the kind of answer required is about character attributes. There are several plausible ways to describe Lee. Multiple clues support forming the opinion that Lee is cautious and nervous about entering and being in the house. He is easily scared. He is also very tired, but willing to go along with Chang, so this would support an opinion that Lee is a follower or willing to try hard to keep up with Chang. Any plausible opinion is acceptable and does not have to be supported with evidence for “partial.”"
"R3.2.1_M","Do you think the boys should stay in the house? Use evidence from the text to support your opinion.","Says Yes or No and uses plausible evidence, e.g., Yes, they need to rest; No, it is not their house","The boys need shelter, so they enter a house that appears to be empty but is also a bit scary. An on-balance judgment is required about the merits or desirability of their actions. There is sufficient evidence in the text to support a range of views and perspectives. The challenge is to form a view and then select the relevant evidence."
"R3.2.1_E","Chang seems to be quite brave in this story. What kind of a boy do you think Lee is? Use evidence from the text to support your opinion.","Supports an opinion about Lee’s character with relevant evidence","Chang being quite brave is provided as an example to show that the kind of answer required is about character attributes. There are several plausible ways to describe Lee. Multiple clues support forming the opinion that Lee is cautious and nervous about entering and being in the house. He is easily scared. He is also very tired, but willing to go along with Chang, so this would support an opinion that Lee is a follower or willing to try hard to keep up with Chang. Any plausible opinion is acceptable, but it has to be supported with relevant evidence from the text for “exceeds.” In this case, a justifiable opinion about Lee is not contrary to expectations, but requires careful consideration of implied ideas to make and support a generalization."
"R3.3.1_M","Which of the following is an opinion? A. Lee was very tired. B. The door wasn’t even locked. C. I don’t like this place. D. We are warm and we can rest.","C. I don’t like this place.","Distinguishing between factual information and opinion can be challenging. For “meets” at this level, prominent clues are provided, as the correct option clearly expresses a personal opinion by using a personal pronoun and expressing dislike. The other statements are factual descriptions of the state of things."
"R3.3.1_E","At the start, Chang says, “No one lives here anymore.” When he says this, does he know it is a fact or is it his opinion? Give a reason.","Selects opinion and identifies that an unlocked door does not ensure that the house is unoccupied","Distinguishing between factual information and opinion can be challenging. For “exceeds” at this level, less prominent clues are provided. Chang’s statement at the start of the text appears to be an assertion of fact, but the only evidence he has is that the door was unlocked, which is insufficient. At this stage, this statement is an opinion."
