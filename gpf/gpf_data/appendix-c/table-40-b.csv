"R2.2.1_E","Why does Chang push Lee forward so that Lee goes first?","Refers to also being a bit scared / not being as bold as he sounds","This is an example of making an inference despite some strongly competing information, as there are implied contradictions in Chang’s behavior. Chang initiates going into the house and boldly declares the door wasn’t even locked, but by insisting Lee go first and pushing him forwards, Chang’s actions imply that he is actually a bit nervous and would rather Lee face whatever might be in the house first. A literal reading that Chang is being kind, or including Lee, is incorrect."
"R2.2.3_P","What is the last noise the boys hear in the story? A. Groan B. Clatter C. Howling D. Scraping","C. Howling","The last event in a sequence of noises described in chronological order is identified. This is made easier by it is also mentioned near the end of the text."
"R2.2.3_M","Number these noises in the order in which the boys hear them: · Tap dripping · Hinge hitting a rock · Clattering on roof · Door creaking open","Order is: 3 2 4 1","Four events are ordered in the sequence in which they are chronologically presented in the text."
"R2.2.4_P","Why doesn’t Lee want to stay in the house?","Refers to not liking it / being scary","Lee’s point of view about not liking the house and finding it scary is explicitly stated towards the end of the text. There are multiple earlier clues that Lee is finding the experience frightening. There is some limited competing information, as Chang is behaving bravely at times, but the characters’ names are used frequently, making pronoun references easy to follow."
"R2.2.4_M","How does Chang feel about being in the house?","2 points: identifies ambivalence 1point: identifies bravery only","For “meets,” only a partial credit is achieved with the clues about Chang’s confidence considered and the clues about his uncertainty ignored."
"R2.2.4_E","How does Chang feel about being in the house?","2 points: identifies ambivalence of bravery and fear 1point: identifies bravery only","For “exceeds,” students who identify Chang’s ambivalence score two points. Chang initiates going into the house and boldly declares the door wasn’t even locked, but by insisting Lee go first and actually pushing him forwards, Chang’s actions imply that he is a bit nervous and wouldrather Lee face whatever might be in the house first. Chang’s voice trails off as he attempts to discount a noise as a bat or a bird, also giving a clue to his uncertainty, but then he bravely says they have to stay because they need to get warm and rest."
"R2.2.5_P","Lee says the house is scary. Describe one thing Lee does that shows he is afraid.","Refers to one of: whispers, grabs Chang’s arm, hisses","Lee says that the house is scary. Grabbing Chang’s arm is the most obvious evidence of his fear, but whispering and hissing are also indications that he is trying to be inconspicuous, which also suggests fear. Apart from the final sentence, all Lee’s previous actions are prompted by fear."
"R2.2.5_M","Describe one piece of evidence that shows that Chang is also afraid.","Refers to one of: pushing Lee through first, voice trailing off","Chang never acknowledges that he is afraid. He speaks boldly at first and bravely at the end, but there are prominent clues about his fear in pushing Lee through the door first and his voice trailing off. There is limited competing information, with two characters making confusion possible; however, the characters’ names are used frequently, making pronoun references easy to follow."
"R2.2.6_M","What did the boys decide to do in the end?","Refers to staying in the house","Connections need to be made across the last four sentences to identify that Chang wants to stay and rest, and despite his initial reluctance, Lee finally decides Chang is correct, clearly implying that they will both stay in the house."
