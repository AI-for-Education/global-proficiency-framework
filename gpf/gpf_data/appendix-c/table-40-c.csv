"R2.3.1_P","This story is called “The Old House.” What is another good name for this story?","Refers to the house being scary, broken down, empty, ghost- like  OR  Refers to an adventure, a thrilling/frightening experience or any other plausible generalization","Generating an alternative, plausible title of this story requires identifying the main idea. The alternative title can focus on the dilapidated nature of the house, the frightening nature of the experience, or the sense of adventure. This is “partial,” as very simple alternatives to the title, such as, “The scary house” or “Chang and Lee’s adventure,” are acceptable answers. There are multiple clues throughout the text for these kinds of answers."
"R2.3.1_M","What is the main idea in the description of the house? A. It is a warm place to rest. B. It makes many scary noises. C. It is out of the wind. D. It needs some repairs.","B. It makes scary noises.","The main idea in the description of the house is that it makes a lot of scary noises. This idea is prominent because it is repeated multiple times with additional detail about the source of the noise or the sound of the noise and is the main focus of the boys’ attention. The need for repairs is a secondary detail that is not elaborated. The house being warm and out of the wind is a reason for staying, but there are no additional details provided to suggest warmth or protection from the wind."
"R3.1.1_M","What is the purpose of this text? A. Tell a story B. Provide a warning C. Give instructions D. Give information","A. tell a story","Identification of text type requires external knowledge of their different features and styles. Narratives are one of the earliest text types introduced. In English, the simpler, more familiar term story is used in the item. The text has prominent familiar story features, as it is concerned with the feelings and interactions between two characters. There is a simple plot: the characters need to rest, have reservations because the house is scary, but eventually decide to stay. The incorrect options are text types for which there is little support in the text, meaning there is little competing information."
"R3.1.1_E","“Probably just a bat or a bird or a ...” Why does the sentence end like this ...?","Refers to voice becoming too quiet to hear, information missing or sentence being unfinished","An ellipsis is unlikely to be a familiar paratextual term, putting this item into “exceeds.” However, there is a clue about the meaning, as Chang’s voice trails off, suggesting that he can no longer be heard or that he has failed to finish the sentence, making it possible to infer the purpose in this text."
"R3.1.2_M","“The door slowly creaked open.” “Creaked” is a good description of the sound the door makes. Copy two or more words from the text that are good descriptions of sounds.","Any two of: groan, sharp, drip, clattering, scraping, howling","At this level, the purpose of word selection to emphasize sound has been provided with an example to ensure the task is clear. There are multiple examples of the similar use of words in the text, making the evidence prominent."
"R3.1.2_E","“’Let’s go in,’ whispered Chang.” “Whispered” tells you how Chang spoke. Copy two different words from the text that tell you other ways that the boys speak.","Refers to two of: boldly, trailed (off), hissed, bravely","At this level, the purpose of word selection to describe how Chang speaks has been provided with an example to ensure the task is clear. There are only three other examples and these are widely separated, making the evidence less prominent. “Boldly” and “bravely” are more commonly used to refer to behavior rather than speech. Similarly, “trailed off” is a less common way of describing speech."
