"R2.3.1_E","What is the main idea of the last paragraph? A. The positive effect of banning fishing. B. The cause and effect of low water levels. C. The different ways that water is used. D. How to save the Sevan trout.","B. The cause and effect of low water levels.","The main idea and the secondary ideas in the last paragraph have been expressed as generalizations, making it a more difficult “exceeds” task to distinguish the main idea. The incorrect options are secondary details that are all mentioned in the last paragraph."
"R3.1.1_M","What is the purpose of this text? A. To tell a story B. To advertise a product C. To give instructions D. To give information","D. Give information","Identification of text type requires external knowledge of their different features and styles. Information texts are one of the earliest text types introduced. The text has prominent, familiar features of an information text as it focuses on the Sevan trout and lists several problems that are endangering the trout. The text opens with some background history, so it could be construed as a story, and the description of the problems and solutions could be construed as instructions, providing some limited competing information about text types."
"R3.2.1_M","Jo and Maria have different opinions about the greatest problem that the Sevan trout faces now. Jo thinks that the greatest problem is the new fish in the lake. Maria thinks that the greatest problem is water levels dropping in the lake. Who do you agree with? Circle one: JoMaria Use evidence from the text to give a reason for your answer.","Selects Jo and refers to the trout starving/dying through competition for food / lack of food (identifying being caught is incorrect, as this is not a problem now) OR Selects Jo and refers to being unable to breed, thus dying out (lack of water is an insufficient response)","Relevant evidence needs to be identified to justify either Jo’s or Maria’s opinion. The evidence is prominent, as it is located close to each of the separate problems. The extent of the threat to the trout is implied in both cases, which is that the trout will die of starvation or failure to breed."
"R3.2.1_E","The new fish caused two problems. Did banning fishing fix them both?","Refers to only fixing the trout being caught, but not their food being eaten","The impact of an action needs to be evaluated. Information about fishing being banned needs to be linked back to the previous paragraph where the two problems are clearly outlined. A simple link is required to identify that banning fishing will stop people catching trout, which is one problem solved. However, contrary to expectations, the other problem of the new fish eating the same food as the trout is not resolved and requires extrapolation beyond the text. The new fish are still in the lake, implying that they are still competing for resources, and possibly in even larger numbers, as they also are no longer being caught."
