"R2.2.4_E","In the story, Nazneen often disagreed with Samsur. How did this make Samsur feel? Use evidence from the text to give a reason for your answer.","Refers to Samsur’s lack of concern or enthusiastic continuation, or his willingness to follow Nazneen’s ideas when challenged over going into the hole","Samsur’s responses to Nazneen’s frequent disagreements with him are described through what he says and does, but his responses are not explicitly stated. Samsur appears somewhat irrepressible. He gaily pursues his ideas of gold in the hole regardless of being called silly, and is not put off by Nazneen’s assertions that the hole is full of dirt. He is set back when challenged to enter the hole, but quickly switches to follow Nazneen’s suggestions of dropping a stone in the hole. Any one of these multiple pieces of evidence are sufficient to describe Samsur’s point of view in his interactions with Nazneen. There is limited competing information, as Samsur’s behavior is quite consistent."
"R2.2.5_M","Samsur suggested that a king had buried a golden sword in the hole. Write one piece of evidence that shows that Nazneen did not believe him.","Refers to one of the following: Nazneen believes Samsur sees things / creates objects out of nothing; Nazneen suggests there is just dirt and more dirt; Nazneen says the hole is made by a wild animal; or Nazneen said the gold coin was a silly idea","There is prominent evidence (multiple different clues) that Nazneen does not believe Samsur’s ideas about a king burying his golden sword in the hole, but she does not explicitly say this. Nazneen tells Samsur not to be silly in the opening lines of the text and explains that Samsur is always seeing things and creating objects out of nothing. Nazneen counters Samsur’s suggestion of a sword with the idea that there is only dirt and that a wild animal made the hole. Any one of these pieces of evidence is sufficient."
"R2.2.5_E","When Nazneen dropped the stone into the hole, there was a splash. What is another piece of evidence that there was water at the bottom of the hole?","Refers to being shiny","The idea that the hole has water at the bottom is implied, with the splash providing an obvious clue. The other evidence of water is that Samsur notices something shiny at the beginning. However, that this first observation is evidence of water is only apparent after reading the whole text. While the mention of “shiny” is at the beginning of the text, the only context provided for what this might be is Samsur’s guesses at gold objects. The idea that that the “shiny something” is water is consequently less prominent."
"R2.2.6_M","Which is the best description of Samsur? A. Brave B. Imaginative C. Sensitive D. Bossy","B: Imaginative","There are several early examples of Samsur’s imagination, as he makes wild guesses about what is down the hole. Nazneen also says her younger brother is always seeing things and creating objects out of nothing. Samsur’s imagination is also at work as he invents a sore foot to avoid going down the hole. This prominent information (because there are multiple examples) needs to be synthesized to generalize that Samsur is imaginative. There is clear evidence in the text to dismiss the incorrect options."
"R3.2.1_M","Do you think Nazneen is kind to Samsur? Yes No Use evidence from the text to give a reason for your opinion.","Says Yes, and refers to Nazneen continuing to play with Samsur, or just smiling when he was clearly making an excuse OR Says No and refers to Nazneen saying Samsur is silly or refusing to believe him","There is prominent evidence in the text to support opposing opinions about whether Nazneen is kind or not. The evidence is prominent, as the main focus of the text is the interactions between Nazneen and Samsur and the way that she treats him as the older sister. The relevant evidence has to be identified from the text to support the selected opinion."
