"R1.2.1_P","Who said, “Maybe it’s a gold coin?”","Samsur","The quote can be directly matched and is prominent in the opening lines of the text. Samsur is named as the speaker in the previous sentence, so the information is adjacent and there is limited competing information, as Nazneen is the other character and a king is also mentioned."
"R1.2.1_M","What did Nazneen drop into the hole?","Refers to a stone","The words “Nazneen drop” can be closely matched to “Nazneen dropped.” The required information, “the stone,” is adjacent, but some tracking back is also required to identify that she is dropping the stone into the hole. The information is not prominent, as it is towards the end of the text."
"R1.3.1_M","According to Nazneen, what sound would show that something alive was in the hole?","Refers to “yelp”","The synonymous matches required are to link “sound” in the question to “hear” in the text and to link “something alive” to an animal. There is competing information, as two other sounds are mentioned."
"R2.1.1_M","Nazneen was peering into the hole. What does “peering” mean? A. Looking B. Climbing C. Reaching D. Digging","A: Looking","“Peering” is likely to be an unfamiliar word for grade seven. The options are all plausible, requiring attention to contextual clues that show Nazneen is not trying to enlarge or enter the hole."
"R2.2.1_M","How did Samsur feel when Nazneen said he could climb into the hole? A. Excited B. Curious C. Frightened D. Disappointed","C: Frightened","The information required is provided across adjacent paragraphs. Samsur turns pale, hesitates, and then declares he cannot go in the hole, as he has a sore foot. The implication that he is afraid is provided by Nazneen at the start of the following paragraph where she clearly reflects that Samsur’s decision has nothing to do with a sore foot."
"R2.2.1_M","According to Nazneen, why did Samsur not want to climb into the hole?","Refers to fearing a big animal","A link must be inferred between Samsur refusing to go into the hole and Nazneen dismissing his reason and implying that Samsur is afraid of the possibility of a large animal in the hole. There is strong competing information, as Samsur says he has a sore foot, but Nazneen immediately dismisses this."
"R2.2.1_E","What was actually in the bottom of the hole?","Refers to water or any other liquid","A link must be inferred across paragraphs to connect the splash at the end of the story back to Nazneen declaring she will drop the stone into the hole. The splash implies water. There is strongly competing information as many other things are suggested as possibilities."
"R2.2.3_M","The children made many suggestions about what was down in the hole. Put the suggestions in order as they appear in the story. · Animal · Coin · Dirt · Sword","Order is: · Animal (4) · Coin (1) · Dirt (3) · Sword (2)","The ideas the children suggest for what is down in the hole are scattered across the first two-thirds of the text, so they are not prominent."
