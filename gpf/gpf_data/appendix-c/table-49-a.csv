"R1.1.1_E","Which of these definitions best explains the meaning of the word “miser”? A. Someone who is easily upset by their neighbor. B. Someone who likes saving wealth rather than spending it. C. Someone who is likely to put their wealth in an unusual place. D. Someone who does not know how to guard a secret.","B. Someone who likes saving wealth rather than spending it.","“Miser” is likely to be a less common word for grade nine students. The definition of the word miser is “a person who hoards wealth and spends as little money as possible.” The brief definitions given in the three distractors each picks up a detail from the fable, so prior knowledge of the word is needed to answer the question correctly. (Note that “miser” in English is likely to be an unknown word for grade nine students. This may not apply in other languages.)"
"R1.2.1_P","How did the miser get a lump of gold?","States that he sold everything he had. May paraphrase or quote directly from the text. Examples of full credit responses: · He sold all he had. · He sold all his stuff. · He bought it. (implicit connection to selling everything he had)","The information is very prominent, as it is given in the first sentence of the text. The term “a lump of gold” is a direct match between the question and the text. This was a Level 1b item in PISA 2009. (published in OECD report on PISA 2009, volume 1, p.105)"
"R2.1.1_M","What does the word “lamentations” mean?","Gives a meaning such as sounds of grief, crying, wailing","This is likely to be an unfamiliar word at this grade level but there are multiple clues as to its meaning: the word “loud” suggests that it is a sound, and “tearing his hair” and the neighbor “seeing him overcome with grief.” (Note that “lamentation” in English is likely to be an unknown word for grade nine students. This may not apply in other languages.)"
"R2.1.1b_M","The miser “began to tear his hair.” Why does someone tear their hair? A. Because their head is painful or itchy. B. Because they are frustrated and angry. C. Because they are trying to shorten their hair. D. Because they want to distract someone else.","B. Because they are frustrated and angry.","The words in this idiomatic expression are common, but the expression itself may not be familiar to students at this level. However, there are multiple contextual clues about the way the miser is feeling at this point in the fable, making the words “angry and frustrated” in the key the only plausible alternative."
"R2.2.1_P","Why did the workman watch the miser’s movements? A. Because he was worried about the miser’s safety. B. Because he was guarding the place where the work was going on. C. Because he had heard about the miser’s gold. D. Because he wanted to know the miser’s secret.","D. Because he wanted to know the miser’s secret.","The task requires relating two pieces of information in consecutive sentences, from: “One of the workmen …” to “… and stole it.” The relationship between the two sentences is not explicitly spelled out but it is clearly causal. There is no plausible competing information for the implication that the workman is watching the miser because he wants to know the reason for the miser’s daily visits (“the miser’s secret”)."
