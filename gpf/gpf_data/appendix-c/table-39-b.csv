"R2.2.5_M","How did the trout get its name?","Refers to the lake","The evidence that the trout is named after the lake is prominent, as it is implied in the first sentence as the only place where the trout is found. The connection to the trout’s name is not explicit."
"R2.2.5_M","The government’s actions suggest that people’s needs are more important than the Sevan trout. Identify evidence from the text that supports this point of view.","Refers to encouraging more fishing or water needed for people more than the trout","The idea that the government’s actions suggest people’s needs are more important than those of the trout is implied. There are two sources of evidence: people are encouraged to fish by putting more fish in the lake, and people’s need for water is not challenged even though it threatens the trout. Another way to save the trout is required. Both pieces of evidence are prominent, as they are the main ideas in the second and third paragraphs, respectively.

"R2.2.5_E","The government’s actions suggest that people’s needs are more important than the Sevan trout. 1. Identify evidence from the text that supports this point of view. AND 2. Identify evidence from the text that challenges this point of view.","1. Refers to encouraging more fishing or water needed for people more than the trout 2. Refers to banning fishing, so the needs of the trout were put first","For exceeds, evidence is also required to challenge this point of view. While the correct information is also prominent, at the start of the third paragraph, it is more challenging to find evidence to support opposing points of view. The idea that the government is now putting the needs of the trout ahead of people is also implied adjacent to strongly competing information, as the rest of the paragraph is about the importance of the needs of people."
"R2.2.6_E","What is the writer’s attitude to the problems of the Sevan trout? A. The writer knows how to solve them. B. The writer hopes that the problem will be solved. C. The writer does not think anyone can solve them. D. The writer thinks they are not worth solving.","B. The writer hopes that the problem will be solved.","The writer’s attitude to the problems of the Sevan trout can be gleaned from some prominent clues indicating that the writer clearly wants the trout to be saved, and some more subtle clues that the writer does not have any ideas or suggestions about how to do this, but hopes that it will happen."
"R2.2.6_M","This text is about the problems of the Sevan trout. Which of these is a good summary of the text? A. The problems are solved. B. The problems are unknown. C. The problems are minor. D. The problems are difficult.","D. The problems are difficult.","The main idea that the Sevan trout still needs to be saved is clearly stated, but the idea that saving it is difficult is implied. This requires synthesis of prominent information from across the whole of the text. There are multiple clues to support this, as the problems outlined in the second paragraph identify unintended serious consequences, only some of which are resolved by banning fishing, and the problems of the water level dropping are left as unresolvable with a new solution desired. The incorrect options reflect substantial misunderstanding of the main idea."
