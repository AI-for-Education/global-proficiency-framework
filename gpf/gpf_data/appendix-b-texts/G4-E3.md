Are you afraid of sharks?

Some sharks are harmless. The dwarf lantern shark cannot hurt you. You might think sharks are large but this one is not. It is so small
you can hold it in one hand.

Another unusual thing about dwarf lantern sharks is that they glow in the dark. They live at the bottom of very deep oceans. There is no
light where they live. They make their own light.
