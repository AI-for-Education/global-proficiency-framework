My name is Aliyah. I live in the mountains with my family. In the summer, we take our sheep up to the mountain meadows where there
is lots of grass for them to eat. We all have strong legs from walking up and down the steep mountain tracks. During the cold winter
months, the sheep stay in the shed to keep warm. Ice makes the tracks slippery. I play sliding games with my brothers and sisters on
the icy tracks. We have fun.
