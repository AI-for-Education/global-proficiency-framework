Than was walking down the stairs at home when he slipped. He fell all the way to the bottom. When he looked at his leg he could see it
was bent up in a strange position.

Mum came running. She touched Than's leg very gently but it still hurt him. There was no blood but his ankle was swelling up fast.

“Ring the ambulance,” Mum called to Dad.

Mum and Dad sat with Than on the stairs while they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Dad told Than not to move in case he made it
worse.
