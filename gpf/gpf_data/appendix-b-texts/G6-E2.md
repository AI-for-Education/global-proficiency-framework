Chang was feeling very cold and Lee was very tired. They needed somewhere to rest so they knocked on the door of an old house. The door slowly creaked open.

“No one lives here anymore. Let’s go in,” whispered Chang.

“How can you be sure?” whispered Lee back.

“The door wasn’t even locked!” Chang said boldly. “You go first,” he added, pushing Lee forward.

The old door swung open with a groan. The bottom hinge fell off and hit a rock. The sharp sound made them jump. They slipped inside.

Through the dust, Lee could see the shape of a bed. He could hear the drip, drip of a leaky tap and something clattering on the iron roof above.

“What’s that noise?” said Lee, grabbing Chang’s arm.

“Probably just a bat or a bird or a …” his voice trailed off.

A strong gust of wind pushed the hanging door back and the loud scraping sound made Lee jump again.

“We might be warm and out of the wind,” he hissed to Chang. “But I don't like this place. It's too scary.”

“It’s better than being outside,” Chang said bravely. “We are warm and we can rest until we are ready to walk again.”

Lee rubbed his tired feet and heard the howling wind outside. He decided that Chang was right.
