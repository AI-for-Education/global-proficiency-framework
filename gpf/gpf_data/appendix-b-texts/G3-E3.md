A proud young fox saw some grapes hanging over a fence. They looked delicious.

“I am strong. I will get some grapes,” said the fox. He jumped up, but it was not high enough. He jumped again, and again. Then the fox
heard a donkey laughing.

“You were boasting and now you look silly,” said the donkey.
