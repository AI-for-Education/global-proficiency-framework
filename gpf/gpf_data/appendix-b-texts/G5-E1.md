The giant coconut crab lives in Asia. It looks the same as any small crab you might see in a rock pool at the beach, but the giant coconut crab can grow to nearly one meter wide. Take one really big step. That is how big this crab can grow, from its legs on one side to its legs on the other side!

The giant coconut crab eats fruit, seeds, and nuts. It can climb coconut palms and pick the coconuts. It uses its strong front claws to make a hole in the tough coconut shell and then it eats the fruit inside.

It has a very good sense of smell, which helps it look for food at night. Sometimes,it picks up shiny things that someone has dropped, like a silver watch or sparkly jewelry, and takes them away.

Giant coconut crabs can live for up to 40 years. Their only enemy is people who like to catch and eat them.

The giant coconut crab is sometimes also called the “robber crab” or “palm thief.”
