Grass grows in soil. It grows quickly with water and warm sun. Grass cannot grow on bare rock, but it can grow in cracks in the rock.
This happens when the wind or rain fills the cracks with soil. Grass seeds that are blown in the wind can land in the cracks filled with
soil. If the seeds get warmth and water then grass will grow in these little pockets of soil.
