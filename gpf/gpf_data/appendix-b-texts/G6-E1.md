The Sevan trout only lives in Lake Sevan in Armenia. It has been in danger of becoming extinct for quite some time.

One reason is that about 50 years ago, whitefish, goldfish, and crayfish were put in the lake to provide more fish for people to catch and eat. The problem was that the new fish ate a lot of the food that the Sevan trout used to eat. Another problem was that more people came to the lake to catch the new fish and they also caught a lot of Sevan trout.

The government banned fishing in the lake and this has helped, but the fish are still endangered because there is often not enough water in the lake for them to breed. The water levels in the lake have dropped because farmers need the lake water for their crops and towns need water for industry and household use. We still need to find a way to save the Sevan trout.
