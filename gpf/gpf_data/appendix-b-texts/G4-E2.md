Noga is the smallest girl in her class. Noga does not like being small.

Her mother tells her not to worry. “It’s ok to be small,” she says. But Noga does not think it is ok to be small.

One day, when Noga is out walking, she hears a chirping sound coming from a small hole in a tree. Noga crawls into the hole and sees
a baby bird. Noga gently picks up the bird.

She crawls out of the hole and gently places the bird onto a branch of the tree. The bird chirps happily.

“How lucky that I was walking past, and not some big kid,” Noga thinks. She smiles and walks home. She keeps smiling the whole way
home.
