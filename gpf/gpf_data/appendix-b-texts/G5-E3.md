Every day Chiumbo took the goats out to find new grass. At night, he brought them home again. Every day was the same.

One day, Chiumbo was so bored that he fell asleep. The goats started walking off down the road, but an old man saw them. He brought the goats back and woke Chiumbo up. “Thank you, old man,” said Chiumbo.

The next day, Chiumbo fell asleep again. An eagle saw Chiumbo and flew down hoping to have baby goat for dinner, but all the other birds made so much noise they woke Chiumbo.

“Thank you, birds,” said Chiumbo as he waved a big stick to frighten the eagle away. “This is good,” said Chiumbo, “I can sleep every day.”

The next day, Chiumbo was asleep in the grass when a thief crept up and stole two of Chiumbo’s goats. When Chiumbo finally woke up, he searched and searched but he could not find the missing goats. Chiumbo was very frightened.

When he got home, his father was waiting. Chiumbo told his father the truth straight away and said that he was very sorry.

“Have you learned your lesson now?” his father said angrily. Then he added, “You are a very lucky boy. A policeman caught the thief and so we’ve got our two goats back.”

And after that, Chiumbo became the best goat minder in the village.
