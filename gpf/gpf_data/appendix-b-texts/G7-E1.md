“I can see something shiny at the bottom,” said Samsur. “Maybe it’s a gold coin.”

“Don’t be silly,” said Nazneen, peering into the hole. Her younger brother was always seeing things, creating objects out of nothing.

“Maybe it’s a sword,” continued Samsur. “Maybe a king buried a gold sword in the ground many years ago, and then forgot about it.”

“Maybe it’s dirt, covered in dirt, covered in more dirt,” said Nazneen. “It’s just a hole, probably made by a wild animal.”

“You are wrong!” exclaimed Samsur. “No animal could make a hole as big as this!”

“Well, if you are so sure this is not an animal’s hole, perhaps you should climb down into it.”

Samsur began to turn pale. “Erm … No. I cannot go in the hole … because … I have a sore foot!”

Nazneen smiled; it had nothing to do with Samsur’s foot. A big hole could mean a big animal.

“I have an idea,” she said, picking up a stone that lay beside her. “I will drop this into the hole. If we hear a clink, there is treasure. If we hear a thud, there is dirt. If we hear a yelp, there is an animal.”

Nazneen dropped the stone and they heard nothing for a moment.

Then they heard a splash.
