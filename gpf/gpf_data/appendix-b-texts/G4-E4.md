In nature, certain animals eat other animals. These animals are called predators. The animals that predators eat are called prey. Prey
do not want to be eaten. So, they have found many ways to avoid being eaten!

Animals like the porcupine have sharp spikes on their bodies to keep predators away.

Animals like spiders and snakes bite poison into their predators. This hurts or kills predators.

Animals like chameleons and octopuses use camouflage so that predators cannot see them.

Animals like gazelles and wildebeest can run fast to get away from predators.

Sometimes prey are lucky and do not get caught, and other times, they are eaten. This is how nature works.
