Salt is something we use every day. You probably eat it in your food to make it taste better. But did you know that salt is important in many other ways?

Salt is very important for your body to work. Your body uses salt to make your muscles move and to help your blood flow. Salt also helps your body use the food you eat. If you have too little salt in you, you may feel dizzy and tired. But, watch out, too much salt can also make you sick!

Salt is also used for cleaning. Some people use it to clean away soot from chimneys or mix it in water to clean burned pots and pans.

Salt is also used to keep food from spoiling. For example, you can add salt to fresh meat or fish to dry it out so it will keep to eat later.

Salt has many uses and is important for people to survive!
