Dear Uncle and Aunty,

I hope this letter finds you well.

Five months have passed since I moved to the city to begin my training at a bank. I thank you both for helping me to have this chance. Next month my training will end and I will be free to look for work elsewhere. My training has been very useful, but I am now thinking of becoming a teacher instead of working in a bank.

As you know, I live in a large apartment block. There are many families with children. In my spare time I have been teaching reading and mathematics to some of these children, because the local school cannot find enough teachers for all the students. I enjoy teaching very much. It makes me very happy to see the children improve each day and want to learn more. They become more confident and they share their new skills with their families. The older children have also started helping the younger children. If every child in this apartment block can read and count well, I am sure they will all grow up to lead good lives for themselves and their families. Two sisters told me they want to work in a bank when they grow up!

Uncle, Auntyâ€”I hope you can understand the reason now why I want to be a teacher. I am always grateful for your support.

Your niece,

Jenny
