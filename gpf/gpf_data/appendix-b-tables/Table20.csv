Text type,Key elements of text type,Features at Grade 6
Narrative (stories),A problem is resolved,"The focus is on characters and how they resolve a dilemma. Interactions may be among several characters. Characters are developed so that motivation and emotional responses are clear, either explicitly or through low-level inference. Actions are clearly related to a consequence."
Information (descriptions),"An event, location, lifestyle, daily habit, object, plant, or animal is described","The focus is on understanding an idea or an event rather than characters. Contexts have some degree of familiarity but with some unfamiliar content and some minor complexities. The information may be presented in continuous format (paragraphs) or in non-continuous format (for example, tables, lists, or labeled diagrams.) Some familiar paratextual features may be used (e.g., captions or sub-headings)."
Persuasive (arguments),A point of view or opinion is presented,"The opinion is explicit or clearly implied. It may take the form of a single argument or several, short, contrasting arguments or opinions on the same subject."
Instructional (procedural),A procedure or method of doing something is presented,"The format is conventional and familiar. It may be presented in continuous format (paragraphs) or in non-continuous format (for example, numbered steps or a flow chart)."
